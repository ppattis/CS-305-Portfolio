### Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements.  Who was the client?  What issue did they want you to address?

Artemis Financial is a financial cosulting company, that provides customized financial plans for savings, retirement, investments, and insurance for their customers.  They are wishing to moderinize their operations and is looking for security upgrades to their website to protect sensitive financial information.

### What did you do particularly well in identifying teir software security vulnerabilities?  Why is it important to code securely?  What value does software security add to a company's overall wellbeing?

I think I took particularly well to the dependency vulnerability testing.  I think that in this day and age it is more than obvious why secure coding and software security is important.  It seems almost like every other day some security vulnerability or hack is announced on the news.  With the wide spread use of the internet, sometimes even on systems that have no business being on the internet, and with the explosion of the internet comes the explosion of vulnerability exploitation.

### What about the process of working through the vulnerability assessment did you challenging or helpful?

I found the Security Vulnerability flowchart was both challenging and helpful.  It was helpful like a checklist, however also very challenging to sometimes understand how each catagory is in play or not.

### How did you approach the need to increase layers of security?  What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to assess vulnerablilities and determine mitigation techniques?

My approach to layering security is to do an initial assesment, and take one step.  Rinse, wash repeat.  Reasses and implement another step.  That way a step that satisfies more than one vulnerability can show all that it satisfies and you don't end up over engineering a solution.

### How did you ensure the code and software applicaiton were functional and secure?  After refactoring code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

The primary way is to unit test it as you refacor or develop.

### What resources, tools, or coding practices did you employ that you might find helpful in future assignmnets or tasks?

Apart from the obvious tool of Dependency Vulnerability checking, I found rigorous commenting helps.  It allows you, as the developer, to express what you intend to accomplish, so that even if it misses that mark, assessing how it missed the mark is easier.

### Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to demonstrate your skills, knowledge, or experience.  What from this particular assignment might you want to showcase to a future employer?

Vulnerability assesment I think is a rather valuable skill to have.
